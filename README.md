Our web application is designed as a simple yet powerful inventory and sales management system. It allows users to add, edit, and delete stock items, record sales, and automatically update stock levels. The app also generates profit reports, highlights low-stock alerts, and provides a downloadable sales history for accountability. By including a login system, the application ensures that only authorised users can access and manage sensitive data. The purpose of this project is to provide small businesses with an easy-to-use tool that combines inventory control, sales tracking, and reporting in one platform.
